**PROJECT CONTEXT:**
Company: ${projectData.companyName}
Project: ${projectData.projectName}
Industry: ${projectData.industryType}
Requirements: "${projectData.projectRequirements}"
Timeline: ${projectData.timeline.value} ${projectData.timeline.unit}
Team: ${projectData.teamMembers.map(member => `${member.role} (${member.experience})`).join(', ')}

**YOUR TASK:**
Research and create EXACTLY 16 SPECIFIC presentation headings using a TWO-TIER approach:

**TIER 1: MANDATORY TRAINED STRUCTURE (8 slides)**
You MUST include these 8 mandatory headings as the foundation:
1. Executive Summary
2. Market Analysis & Industry Overview
3. Solution Architecture & Technical Approach
4. Implementation Strategy & Methodology
5. Project Timeline & MilESTONES
6. Risk Management & Mitigation
7. Financial Analysis & ROI Projections
8. Success Metrics & Performance Indicators

**TIER 2: RESEARCH-BASED CUSTOMIZATION (8 slides)**
After the mandatory structure, generate EXACTLY 8 additional headings that are:
- Customized to their specific project and industry
- Based on research of their requirements: "${projectData.projectRequirements}"
- Specific to ${projectData.industryType} industry challenges
- Addressing unique problems mentioned in their requirements
- Each heading should focus on a different aspect of their project requirements

**ADAPTIVE BEHAVIOR:**
If the user has deleted some mandatory headings from their presentation structure, adapt your content generation accordingly:
- Generate content for the remaining mandatory headings that are still present
- Adjust the research-based content to fill any gaps created by deleted mandatory sections
- Ensure the final document/presentation maintains logical flow and completeness
- If a mandatory section is missing, incorporate its key points into other relevant sections

âœ… **TAILORED** to ${projectData.companyName}'s ${projectData.projectName} project
âœ… **INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC** for ${projectData.industryType} sector
âœ… **REQUIREMENT-FOCUSED** addressing: "${projectData.projectRequirements}"
âœ… **PROFESSIONAL** business presentation style

**STRICT REQUIREMENTS:**
ðŸš« **FORBIDDEN**: Generic headings like "Market Analysis", "Solution Overview", "Implementation Strategy" (unless part of mandatory structure)
ðŸš« **FORBIDDEN**: One-size-fits-all business templates
ðŸš« **FORBIDDEN**: Headings that could apply to any company/project

âœ… **REQUIRED**: Include ALL 8 mandatory trained structure headings
âœ… **REQUIRED**: Each additional heading must be specific to this project context
âœ… **REQUIRED**: Use industry terminology relevant to ${projectData.industryType}
âœ… **REQUIRED**: Address specific challenges in their requirements
âœ… **REQUIRED**: Consider their team's experience level

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
Return ONLY a JSON array of strings (no additional text):
["Executive Summary", "Market Analysis & Industry Overview", "Solution Architecture & Technical Approach", "Implementation Strategy & Methodology", "Project Timeline & MilESTONES", "Risk Management & Mitigation", "Financial Analysis & ROI Projections", "Success Metrics & Performance Indicators", "Custom Heading 9", "Custom Heading 10", "Custom Heading 11", "Custom Heading 12", "Custom Heading 13", "Custom Heading 14", "Custom Heading 15", "Custom Heading 16"]

**EXAMPLES OF RESEARCH-BASED HEADINGS (DO NOT COPY - CREATE YOUR OWN):**
Healthcare AI: ["AI Diagnostic Accuracy for Radiology", "HIPAA Compliance Framework", "EMR Integration Strategy"]
FinTech: ["Digital Payment Security Architecture", "Regulatory Compliance for Financial APIs", "Fraud Detection Implementation"]
E-commerce: ["Customer Acquisition Cost Optimization", "Inventory Management Automation", "Conversion Rate Enhancement Strategy"]

        : `**SLIDE STRUCTURE APPROACH:**
You will generate a comprehensive business presentation using a TWO-TIER approach:

**TIER 1: TRAINED STRUCTURE (MANDATORY BASE SLIDES)**
Generate content for these 8 core slides that follow proven business proposal structure:

# SLIDE 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
# SLIDE 2: MARKET ANALYSIS & INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
# SLIDE 3: SOLUTION ARCHITECTURE & TECHNICAL APPROACH
# SLIDE 4: IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY & METHODOLOGY
# SLIDE 5: PROJECT TIMELINE & MILESTONES
# SLIDE 6: RISK MANAGEMENT & MITIGATION
# SLIDE 7: FINANCIAL ANALYSIS & ROI PROJECTIONS
# SLIDE 8: SUCCESS METRICS & PERFORMANCE INDICATORS

**TIER 2: RESEARCH-BASED ADDITIONAL SLIDES**
After completing the trained structure above, conduct research and analysis on their specific requirements: "${projectData.projectRequirements}"

Based on your research, generate EXACTLY 8 ADDITIONAL slides that are:
- Specific to their project requirements: "${projectData.projectRequirements}"
- Relevant to their ${projectData.industryType} industry challenges
- Addressing unique problems mentioned in their requirements
- Providing additional value beyond the standard structure
- Each slide should focus on a different aspect of their project requirements

**MANDATORY REQUIREMENT:**
You MUST include BOTH the trained structure headings AND research-based headings in your final output. The trained structure provides the foundation, and the research-based headings add customization specific to their project.
 **Check for the Repeatative headings and remove them**
 **Check for the headings that are not relevant to the project and remove them**
 **Check with both trained mandatory heading and research-based additional headings and remove the headings if it is repeatative**

**RESEARCH PROCESS FOR ADDITIONAL SLIDES:**
1. Analyze their specific requirements: "${projectData.projectRequirements}"
2. Research ${projectData.industryType} industry challenges and opportunities
3. Identify gaps in the standard structure for their specific needs
4. Generate EXACTLY 8 additional slides that address their unique requirements
5. Ensure these slides complement, not duplicate, the trained structure
6. Each slide should cover a different aspect of their project requirements

**EXAMPLE ADDITIONAL SLIDES (based on research):**
- Industry-specific compliance requirements for ${projectData.industryType}
- Unique technical challenges for their specific project
- Specialized market considerations for their industry
- Custom integration requirements based on their needs
- Specific risk factors for their industry/project combination
- Specialized success metrics for their business model
- Industry-specific ROI considerations and benchmarks

**TOTAL SLIDES: 16 slides (8 trained + 9-16 research-based)**

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
âœ… **SPECIFIC** to ${projectData.companyName}'s ${projectData.projectName} project
âœ… **RELEVANT** to ${projectData.industryType} industry challenges
âœ… **ADDRESSING** the requirements: "${projectData.projectRequirements}"
âœ… **APPROPRIATE** for the team's experience level: ${projectData.teamMembers.map(member => `${member.role} (${member.experience})`).join(', ')}
âœ… **LOGICAL** presentation flow for business stakeholders
âœ… **Check for the Repeatative headings and remove them**
âœ… **Check for the headings that are not relevant to the project and remove them**
âœ… **Check with both trained mandatory heading and research-based additional headings and remove the headings if it is repeatative**


**FORBIDDEN GENERIC HEADINGS:**
ðŸš« Do NOT use: "Market Analysis", "Solution Overview", "Implementation Strategy"
ðŸš« Do NOT use generic business presentation templates
ðŸš« Do NOT use one-size-fits-all slide titles

**REQUIRED HEADING FORMAT:**
Generate headings in this exact format, combining BOTH trained structure AND research-based content:

# SLIDE 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
# SLIDE 2: MARKET ANALYSIS & INDUSTRY OVERVIEW  
# SLIDE 3: SOLUTION ARCHITECTURE & TECHNICAL APPROACH
# SLIDE 4: IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY & METHODOLOGY
# SLIDE 5: PROJECT TIMELINE & MILESTONES
